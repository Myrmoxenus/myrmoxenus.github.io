Personal portfolio website using bootstrap.

I struggled to make it responsive and it doesn't appear to currently work too well on mobile.

I'm also uncertain how to make the contact me button do something meaningful.

I think I probably underestimated this assignment, but I've run out of time and I wanted to submit what I had. 

I will continue to update it.

Also, I had to replace Homework 1 running on my GitPage, but it hasn't been graded yet.

Anyways, sorry this is incomplete. I'll try and correct it soon.
